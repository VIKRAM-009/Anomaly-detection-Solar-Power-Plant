**Solar Power Plant Anomaly Detection**

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on detecting anomalies in solar power plant data using machine learning and rule-based analysis. Anomalies in solar power generation can indicate faulty inverters, sensor malfunctions, environmental interferences, or operational inefficiencies. By implementing unsupervised learning techniques, this project aims to enhance reliability, efficiency, and predictive maintenance for solar energy systems.

**Problem Statement**
Solar power plants generate large volumes of real-time data, including DC power, module temperature, irradiance, humidity, and inverter performance. Unexpected deviations from normal patterns can lead to:
- Reduced energy output
- Equipment damage
- Higher operational costs
- Inefficiencies in power grid integration

To address these challenges, this project applies anomaly detection models to identify, classify, and visualize unusual patterns in the dataset.

**Approach & Methodology**

**Data Preprocessing**
- Time-series feature engineering with 3-hour time bins
- Handling missing values & outliers
- Standard scaling while preserving time-dependent columns

**Machine Learning Models Used**
- Isolation Forest
- Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
- One-Class SVM
- K-Means Clustering
- DBSCAN

**Ensemble Approach:** A data point is classified as an anomaly if it is detected by 3 or more models.

**Rule-Based Analysis**
A separate rule-based system was implemented using business logic to validate anomalies detected by the ML models. This ensures high accuracy and minimal false positives.

**Visualizations & Insights**
Key insights from the project:
- GII vs DC Power Trends to understand fluctuations in power generation
- Correlation Analysis to determine key influencing factors (e.g., Temperature vs Power)
- Anomaly Distribution across different time bins
- Bar Graph Representation of rule-based anomaly classifications
